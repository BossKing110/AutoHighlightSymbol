Auto Highlight Symbol
=====================

Xcode can highlight instances of selected symbol, but what it does is to add dash lines under the instances, which is hard to be noticed.

AutoHighlightSymbol is a plugin for Xcode, it adds background highlight color to those instances. It's super useful while you're tracing codes, especially when you want to figure out where a specific varible is used in a certain method.

This plugin is still in early beta, you're welcome to improve it and send me pull requests.

**NOTICE**:

You need to enable *Highlight instances of selected symbol* option first from *Xcode preferences -> Text Editing*.
